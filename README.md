## JAX Series üßä
Exploring JAX for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research.

**Part 1: Intro to JAX and JAX AI**
- Automatic differentiation with grad() and vmap().
- XLA compilation for GPU/TPU acceleration.
- How JAX is transforming modern AI research through functional programming and hardware acceleration.

**Part 2: JAX for Combinatorial Optimisation**
We investigated how to use JAX to accelerate parallel search algos for the ``Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem`` which has real-world applications in:
- Computer Security
- Bioinformatics
- Formal Verification
- Spectrum Auction Design
It helped me understand JAX's potential for building fast, research-ready tools!
